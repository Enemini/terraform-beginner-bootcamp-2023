## Semantic Versioning

### Summary
 When you are making changes to your code, it is important to ensure that the changes are being tagged and versioned properly and one way to do so is to understand the use of semantics apropriately, hence we will review some of the features below:


- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner.
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes


Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

### Introduction
In the world of software management there exists a dreaded place called “dependency hell.” The bigger your system grows and the more packages you integrate into your software, the more likely you are to find yourself, one day, in this pit of despair.

As usual, do not depend only on the content of this document as google [https://www.google.com] id always a friend on further research.
